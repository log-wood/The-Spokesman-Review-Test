            The Spokesman-Review works with local and national foundations to
            help fund some of the journalism in our newspaper. What makes this
            partnership unique is that we are one of the only news
            orginizations in the nation to then release the copyright of these
            stories publicly through Creative Commons. That means journalism
            funded by our community is actually owned by our community, not by
            our newspaper. All of this money goes directly to offsetting the
            salaries of reporters in our newsroom and is tax deductible.
